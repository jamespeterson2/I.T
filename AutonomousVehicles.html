        Autonomous vehicles are cars capable of sensing their surrounding environments without the need for a passenger to operate the vehicle, bringing a passenger from the starting point to the set destination in autopilot. The current state-of-the-art of this modern technology which requires a driver to be present is Tesla who first implemented an autopilot system in September 2014 featuring auto-steer, auto-park, and traffic aware cruise control. The current state of the art of this innovative technology which does not require a driver to be present is Googleâ€™s Waymo project which began in 2009. This state-of-the-art technology allows vehicles to operate autonomously, making the frustration that comes with driving a thing of the past with the aim of decreasing deaths worldwide and reducing crashes involving human error. To improve the ability of autonomous vehicles to operate properly on the roads is to improve the condition of the roads. Not only this but due to drivers having to communicate with each other and the ability to process complex situations such as a road blockage, autonomous vehicles would need to take into account human gestures such as a wave to allow them to go first without disregarding human gestures. If not executed properly, these autonomous vehicles may become a hazard on the roads we share. Additionally, cameras may be challenged by immense amounts of sunlight reflecting on its sensors impairing the ability of automated vehicles to operate in a safe manner or laser sensors may be challenged by fog or heavy rainfall, impairing the ability to detect any nearby objects thus increasing the risk of a crash. The likely advancements for autonomous vehicles to be performed in the near future is that autonomous vehicles may implement infrared sensors to their cameras allowing them to safely operate and interact with road rules in a more efficient manner as opposed to relying solely on cameras detecting road signs, other vehicles, and pedestrians. On the other hand, if there were to be an increase in autonomous vehicles, we would need to implement smarter road signs and traffic lights to send messages to the autonomous vehicles for them to process and act on whether they should go, stop, or slow down.

        The potential impact of this innovation is that there will be a decrease in the number of deaths that occur on the roads, therefore decreasing, the number of crashes involving human error. Additionally, autonomous vehicles will be able to reduce travel time for its users allowing passengers to arrive at their set destination in a timely manner. It is without a doubt that there will be less drivers on the roads if autonomous vehicles were to be implemented on the roads and due to the nature of autonomous vehicles being fully electric, there will be less carbon pollution pushing society towards an eco-friendlier future. In terms of who will be affected, companies such as Ubers or Taxis making their employees to become redundant consequentially, increasing the likeliness of homeless rates due to lack of income for certain individuals that are unable to replace their jobs. However, on the business side, companies will profit exponentially from this as they would not need to pay their drivers, allowing them to take home the majority of profits made.
