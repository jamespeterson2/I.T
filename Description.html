      <p>
        The project will involve the Development of a website in which the user can select a relevant university within Australia and have relevant scholarships and grants pop up based on eligibility criteria using data previously imputed by the user. The website will also have various filters in order to adjust the scope with which scholarships/grants that the user is eligible for are shown. Data imputed can be criteria such as:
        </p>

      <h5> GPA </h5>
<p> The user will be able to input their GPA based on a scale of 0.0 to 4.0 
</p>
  <h5> Level of Study so far (e.g., Undergraduate, Masters, PHD, None) </h5>
<p>As there are numerous levels of studies which each offering its own scholarships, the user can input what study they have completed so far to further refine the data presented to them. After the level of study is inputted, the user must also input the exact degree/certificate for which they have studied in order to refine the search.
</p>
<h5>Gender  </h5>
<p> As some scholarships are offered based on whether the individual submitting is a woman in their field of study, Users will be allowed to input whether they are Male, Female or Other 
</p>
<h5> Indigenous </h5>
<p> Educational benefits and scholarships are available to any individuals that are considered Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. It is vital that this is included into the criteria as a large majority of scholarships are catered solely to, or rate indigenous individuals as one of their top priorities. 
</p>
<h5> International Citizen  </h5>
<p> There are a great number of scholarships that are catered towards individuals who are either a refugee seeking asylum or an international student. The user will be able to choose from 3 options: Option A: Australian Citizen or Permanent resident, Option B: Current or Former Refugee or Option C: International. If option C is chosen, then the user must input their visa details in addition to the country they hold a passport for. 
</p>
<h5> Rural citizen </h5>
  <p> Individuals can be eligible for some scholarships if they live in or relocate from a rural area.
</p>
<h5> Hardships experienced  </h5>
<p> This will be the section with the most data able to be imputed, with the criteria being:
  <ul>
    <li>financial disadvantage such as</li>
     <ul><li>receiving a government tested low-income benefit or having a Centrelink Health Care Card</ul></li> 
    <li>circumstance/s which impact your ability to study such as</li>
     <ul><li>having a long-term medical condition or disability</ul></li> 
  <ul><li>experiencing personal/family/social difficulties</ul></li> 
<ul><li>have previously/are currently living in foster/kinship care or are a ward of the state</ul></li> 
</ul>

<p> As the database is only being used to refine and showcase to the user what scholarships they are eligible for there is no need for the user to describe the exact disability or social difficulties they experience. Instead, they can remain a checklist yes/no system, with the user assessing whether their individual circumstance makes them eligible when they apply. 
</p>
<p> The user will also be able to select which university within Australia and its offered grants/scholarship eligibility criteria they would like to compare their data against. For the sake of time constraints, the project will begin with RMIT as its sole source of scholarship data.  
The website will allow for filters to be applied to further narrow down any useful information that is independent of the criteria inputted above such as
</p>

<h5> Submission deadline </h5>
<p> It is pointless for certain scholarships to be displayed on the top of the list if the user is ineligible to apply due to the application period ending
</p>
<h5> Amount offered </h5>
<p> The value of the scholarship can vary, showcasing the amount offered will offer more data for the user to evaluate.
</p>
<h5> Scholarship type (i.e.: Accommodation, achievement)</h5>
<ul>
   <li>To further refine the users search, the following type will be available; </li>
     <ul><li>All scholarships</ul></li> 
  <ul><li>Access and Equity</ul></li> 
<ul><li>Accommodation</ul></li>
<ul><li>Achievement</ul></li> 
<ul><li>Indigenous</ul></li> 
<ul><li>International</ul></li> 
<ul><li>Women</ul></li> 
</ul>

<p> Offering these quality-of-life improvements to the search refining can allow the user to sort scholarships through the listed filters will allow for an experience that is further catered to their requirements.
</p>
<p>The website design will remain simple, with only three main dropdown buttons on the page as that is all that’s needed. The about page will outline the purpose of the website, as stated in the motivation section above, in addition to a page catered to the creation of the website and details about us. The search section will include all the refinements outlined earlier, however in order to click on any of the tabs it will require the user to login or sign up, which if they haven’t already will take them to that section to do so. This is important as the website will need to save any criteria the user inputs in order to cater the search to their unique circumstances. If the website is unable to save any data the user inputs, they could be put off using the website due to the time-consuming process needed to input their own criteria. Lastly the participating universities tab will be simple, a list of all the participating universities in order to inform the user of the available scholarships within the database.
