          The table above shows the results of different personality tests taken
           by the members of our group and their ideal jobs. From the personality
           tests, we can see a diverse range of individuals who may impact how we
           operate as a group. For example, we only have 2 extroverts in the group,
           these members will be the driving force of most of the discussions held in meetings.
           Our group is also heavily towards logical thinkers, even though these tests are not
           100% accurate we must take them into account to ensure our weaknesses are covered and
           strengths are utilised within the group environment. To see how we operated in the group
           environment please refer to the <A HREF="GroupReflection.html"> Group Reflection </A> page.
        </p>
        <p>
          By looking at everyone's ideal jobs it is clear that whilst they are mostly revolved around the
          field of IT there is a vast difference in the specific skills required for each of these jobs. Gurpreet
          and Austin have similarities in their respective fields of cyber security analysts and network engineering, with cyber security being more of an expert field within networks and Internet services. James and Jason Tek all want to pursue careers where software skills are the most required when compared to the rest of the group, with their dream jobs requiring skills in HTML, CSS, Java, JavaScript and other coding languages and software tools. Tommy and Jason Dang both have ideal jobs which can be viewed as more business-oriented and require some but not a vast knowledge in the IT field.
          Unlike like James they will be required to know how to use different tech tools but not an understanding
          of the operations behind them. For a more detailed overview of the various positions chosen please refer
          to the <A HREF="IndustryData.html">Industry Data</A> page.
