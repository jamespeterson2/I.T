          This group worked well together, and everyone contributed and was present for group discussions. I personally believe nothing much could have been improved however if I were to have to say anything it would be that the group needed more of a grasp of GitHub, HTML, and CSS however this is an introduction subject, so it is not a massive issue. The only other issues were many others in the group including myself fail to tart conversations about the groups work, thus showing lacking leadership skills. For me, the most surprising thing I found within this group was just how well everyone communicated as throughout my university semesters I have had group projects with people that failed to communicate as well as this group did. Also, during my work with this team, I found out just how powerful the use of Microsoft teams is as a collaborative software for group projects as it has aided the creation of our reports massively as its allowed instantiations file haring making it easier to communicate our ideas and track our progress as a grou

          Our Group worked at a high level in an extremely professional manner. We were able to organise meeting times where our group had 100% attendance in all meetings we had. I was surprised with
          the amount of professionalism in the group, usually team members are a bit scared to provide feedback but everyone in our group everyone provided open honest feedback on tasks and ensured
           everyone's work was kept to a high standard and all our deadlines within the group. In our group the areas we could improve include use of functions in teams, a lot of team members were
           still unaware of a lot of the functionality in teams which is an area that will require improvement in the future to assist in team meetings in the future.

          This group assignment went really well overall. Each member of our group was present for all meetings, communication was kept the whole time and clear goals and times for work to be completed were set. There were never any unrealistic deadlines or amounts of work for any individual. Even if somebody got assigned a large chunk of work someone else would join in and lend a hand. Overall, I think the work was evenly distributed. I can’t complain at all with any of the effort put in by any members of our group. We did have some struggles in certain sections, however. Overall, our groups knowledge of GitHub, HTML and CSS languages were lacking, and this section of the assignment could be difficult at times. Other than that, the only issue we had was sometimes forgetting to record our meetings. I personally had never used MS Teams before this assignment and now feel a lot more confident in using it and all the tools that come with it. When I was setting up the interview with our IT professional, I realised how useful the recording and transcript features of Teams is especially when it comes to an assignment like this.
